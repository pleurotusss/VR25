th_sun V.1.0

INSTALLATION:
--------------------------------------------------
Drop the folder "th_sun" into
/CelestiaResources/extras/addons/
(If the Addons folder does not exist, create it).



NOTE ABOUT A PORTRAIT OF OR SUN:
--------------------------------------------------
This is a semi-real G-star model. It is based on
real imagery, but the detail beyond level 3 of
the hi-res virtual texture is of course imaginary.
If you are a realism-purist, just remove levels
2-10 from the hi-res folder.

Important: if you have a modest computer setup,
you should delete the "th_suncover.png" file
from the  textures/hires/ folder; else, the haze
it provides will not be drawn.



SIGHTS TO SEE:
--------------------------------------------------
Turn on Locations: Other, to see a landmark that
lets you zoom in on an enormous sunspot.

To see the flares, make sure cloud rendering
is ON.



CREDITS
--------------------------------------------------
Thanks to Frank Gregorio for permission to use
his own Sun Solar System Catalog data for this
add-on.

Thanks also to Cham, for his contribution to
the solar flare animation; basically, he wrote
it, and i messed it up afterwards.
